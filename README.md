# Data Structures and Algorithms – Coursework Repository

## Overview

This repository contains a collection of my work from the Data Structures and Algorithms course completed as part of my Computer Science degree. The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate my understanding of fundamental algorithmic concepts, problem-solving techniques, and software engineering practices used in real-world systems.

The projects in this repository emphasize correctness, efficiency, and clear implementation. Each assignment focuses on building strong foundations in data modeling, complexity analysis, and structured thinking.

## Topics Covered

This repository includes implementations and exercises covering the following core areas:

* Arrays and dynamic memory
* Linked lists (singly and doubly linked)
* Stacks and queues
* Hash tables and collision handling
* Trees and binary search trees
* Graphs and traversal algorithms
* Sorting algorithms
* Searching techniques
* Recursion and backtracking
* Time and space complexity analysis
* Algorithm optimization and tradeoffs

## Goals of This Repository

The main goals of this work were to:

* Build a strong foundation in algorithmic thinking
* Understand how data structures impact performance and scalability
* Practice writing clean, maintainable, and testable code
* Develop problem-solving strategies applicable to software engineering and data engineering
* Learn to evaluate tradeoffs between different approaches

These skills directly support my work in backend development, data engineering, and building reliable data systems.

## Structure

The repository is organized by topic and assignment. Each folder contains:

* Source code implementations
* Test cases and example inputs
* Documentation and explanations where relevant

Where appropriate, solutions include comments explaining:

* Design decisions
* Complexity considerations
* Edge cases
* Potential improvements

## Technologies and Languages

Most implementations were completed using:

* Python
* SQL (for certain algorithmic data problems)

The focus was not on language-specific features, but on understanding the underlying logic and performance of each solution.

## Key Learning Outcomes

Through this coursework, I developed the ability to:

* Break down complex problems into structured steps
* Analyze algorithmic efficiency using Big-O notation
* Debug and validate solutions using systematic testing
* Design data-driven systems with performance in mind
* Communicate technical reasoning clearly

These experiences have been especially valuable in my work building and debugging data pipelines, where efficiency and correctness are critical.

## Future Improvements

I plan to continue expanding this repository by:

* Adding more advanced graph and dynamic programming problems
* Including performance benchmarks
* Refactoring solutions for clarity and scalability
* Incorporating real-world case studies and system design perspectives
